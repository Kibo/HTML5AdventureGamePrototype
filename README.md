# HTML5 adventure game prototype.

This HTML5 game prototype is build over [Crafty HTML5 game engine](http://craftyjs.com/ "Crafty HTML5 game engine").

This prototype is trying to show how to design a **conversation between characters in an adventure game** based on interviews.

It is possible to add various types of converzation and select the behavior of the characters based on their answers.

# HTML5 adventure game prototype.

This HTML5 game prototype is build over [Crafty HTML5 game engine](http://craftyjs.com/ "Crafty HTML5 game engine").

This prototype is trying to show how to design a **conversation between characters in the adventure game** based on the conversation.

It is possible to add various types of converzation and select the behavior of the characters based on their answers.

**See:**
- game/components/talkable.js
- game/dialog/*
- test/talkable.html

**This sample is inspired by Crafty game prototype:**
- [Craty: GameThesis](https://github.com/paxell/GameThesis "Crafty adventure prototype")

I will be grateful for the constructive comments.
